PIG => Day 3:
-------------

NOTE: after the session, try to do the PIG commands in MR way


Local => $ pig -x local
Cluster => $ pig

Examples:
--------
-- for input
A = LOAD '/etc/passwd';

-- to see the content in a relation
DUMP A;

What is "A"?
	=> a VARIABLE
	=> a RELATION
	=> a ALIAS
	=> a BAG
	=> an OUTER BAG
	
	different names for the same thing.

-- to see the schema in a relation
DESCRIBE A;

-- with delimiter
B = LOAD '/etc/passwd' USING PigStorage(':');

DESCRIBE B;

-- pig is case insensitive most of the times (i.e. any case is fine for pig commands)
-- pig is case sensitvie in few parts (names of relations + names of functions)

-- can we process this unstructrud data? using the fields? YES
-- by using POSITIONAL PARAMETERS

P = FOREACH B GENERATE $0, $5;
DESCRIBE P;

-- with schema 
C = LOAD '/etc/passwd' USING PigStorage(':') AS (name:chararray,x:chararray,x1:chararray,x2:chararray,x3:chararray,home:chararray,shell:chararray);
DUMP C;

P = FOREACH C GENERATE home,shell;

-- utility commands (sh prefix allows you to run a linux command in the grunt/pig shell)
grunt> sh ls -l

-- fs command (works based on your pig invocation mode either local or cluster)
grunt> fs -ls /

-- group
G = GROUP P By shell;
DUMP G;
DESCRIBE G;

H = FOREACH G GENERATE group;
H = FOREACH G GENERATE group, COUNT(group);

-- take away for the day
