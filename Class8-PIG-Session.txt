What is Hadoop? [Both]
	> Storage => HDFS => Hadoop Distributed File System
	> Processing => YARN/MR => Yet Another Resource Negotiator

Hadoop1 => HDFS + MR
Hadoop2 => HDFS + YARN

HDFS => NameNode + DataNode
YARN => ResourceManager + NodeManager
MR => JobTracker + TaskTracker

What is the tiny unit of Storage?
	=> Blocks(64MB/128MB) => DataNode(slave) => NameNode(master)

What is the tiny unit of Computational Resource?
	=> Containers => NodeManager => ResourceManager
	
Who will do the work? if any? master or slave? SLAVES

When you call a machine as slave machine? what processes does it need to have?
		> NodeManager + DataNode

	HDP1 => 64 MB; HDP2 => 128 MB

To program in Hadoop, what is the way => Using MapReduce => Java

What is Map?
	=> a logic applied on the divided data
	
What is Reduce?
	=> a logic applied on the intermediate data to produce an aggregated final result.

What is aggregation?
	> converting many inputs into a one/single output using some arithmetic.
	
What are examples of aggregation?
	> 1,2,3 => SUM => 6 
	> 1,2,3 => MIN => 1 
	> 1,2,3 => MAX => 3
	> 1,2,3 => AVG => 2
	> 1,2,3 => COUNT => 3

What is consolidation?
	> keeps things together
	
What are examples of consolidation?
	> 1 2 3 => concatenate => 123

PIG:
---

NOTE: this is very very simple. Be an expert here. 

max we have 40 commands => day-to-day life we use 15 commands.

Need?

User => Hadoop => Result
User => Java => MapReduce => Hadoop => Result

in the world, everyone doesnt know java:
	
	Yahoo => invented PIG : a tool to EASE the usage/interaction with hadoop

User => Java => MapReduce => Hadoop => Result
User => Commands => PIG => Java => MapReduce => Hadoop => Result

PIG => convenience
MR => control

PIG => full form 

Hadoop => can work on any data (structured/semi-structured/un-structured)
PIG => an animal can eat anything.

Hadoop => Elephant 

What is PIG? an ecosytem component.
MS-OFFICE	=> lives on top of foundation	Pig
----------									------------
MS-Windows	=> platform/foundation			Hadoop

What is data Processesing?
	> update
	> insert
	> delete		=> above 3 are record level modifications
	> move places	=> a file level operation

	> select
	> filter/search
	> sort / order by
	> aggregations / group by
	> distinct
	> etc

	90% of the time the above are used in data analysis.
	
Data Processing => Data Manipulation + Data Analysis

Hadoop is used for Analysis of data. 

Music Sythesizer => MapReduce
IPod => Pig
