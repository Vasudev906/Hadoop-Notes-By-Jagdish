What is Hadoop? [Both]
	=> Storage
	=> Processing

What is PIG? [Processing]
	=> Storage
	=> Processing

HIVE:
----

Designed for the ease of use to interact with Hadoop.

User => Java => MapReduce => Hadoop => Result

User => SQL => HIVE => Java => MapReduce => Hadoop => Result

User just need to know about SQL commands.

In HIVE => hql => Hive Query Language => very similar to SQL

sql> Can you write a meaningful query without having a table name in the query?
		=> NO
		
		to use SQL => we must need Tables
		
		Do we have tables in HDFS? NO. All are files/folders

HDFS => file/folders => HIVE => Tables => Storage
YARN => MapReduce => HIVE => SQL => Processing

HIVE is a magic/illusion which makes us feel like we are using tables and sql.
	But we are actually using the same old HDFS and MR.

What is HIVE? [Both]
	=> Storage
	=> Processing

HIVE is inspired by MySQL database => so the sql commands some what similar to it.

When we install hive, Hive folder is location in HDFS at
		/user/hive/warehouse

1. create database
hive> create database World;

/user/hive/warehouse/World.db

2. create table
hive> create table India (...); we need to provide schema

/user/hive/warehouse/World.db/India

3. put data into system (we do insert in normal databases)
hive> Load 'file.txt' into table ....

/user/hive/warehouse/World.db/India/file.txt

4. we are ready to analysis
hive> select count(*) from India;

HIVE and SQL => are same

Common in pig and hive:
1. both are easy to learn
2. both can process the data
3. both takes less time to develop

PIG. do it quickly. Adhoc request. immeadiate research.
good skills with ETL => they choose pig

Hive over PIG:
--------------
1. We are dealing with Storage :: Persistence
2. We can connect to HIVE with JDBC/ODBC connectors
3. Having a long term organizational setup
good skills with SQL => they choose HIVE

Schema on Write, RDBMS, we use schema to write the data
vs
Schema on Read, HIVE, we use schema to read the data

hive> create table some_table(some schema) ... delimiter ',' ..

----input.txt
hi,hello,how-are,you

delimiter ',' => hi			hello		how-are			you

delimiter '-' => hi,hello,how			are,you

HIVE has MetaStore: table => a file or folder => a word 'India' is a table related to a path '/user/hive/warehouse/World/India'

relationship information => is called metadata(for hive) here => METASTORE , (an RDBMS=> can be any thing Mysql or Oracle)

HIVE has External Tables:

Some Times : data is already there in HDFS, you need to play with it like a table.
	we want to project a table structure on top of the Folder.
	
/Surendra/Australia

hive> create external table aussie (....) LOCATION '/Surendra/Australia';

if you drop normal table => data + metadata both deleted
if you drop external table => metadata only deleted

Major Advantage External: speed, safety, sharing

Assignments:
-------------
1. Consolidate the mapreduce Questions.
2. download olympic data
3. write word problems for it, each 15 question
4. consoliate your questions
5. make pig command to answe those 10 qustions, individually, given by me
