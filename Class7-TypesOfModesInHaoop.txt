Deamon => long running process (linux word)
4 processes

Types of Installation:

1. Full distributed Mode:
	* we are really using hadoop (stroage + process layers)
	* we have more than one machine (10s or 100s)
	ex: production cluster
	
2. Psuedo distributed mode:
	* we are really using hadoop (stroage + process layers)
	* we use only one machine
	ex: development / testing / vm
	
3. Stand Alone Mode:
	* No hadoop
	* only hadoop libraries
	* adhoc operation, quick check

How many mappers?
	=> system decides based on data size
How many reducers?
	=> user control, 0, 1, many
	default is 1
	
	# job.setNumReduceTasks(0); -- no aggregation, got answer at map level itself
	# job.setNumReduceTasks(1); -- aggregation, need exactly one, like min or max
	# job.setNumReduceTasks(3); -- aggregation, if it doesnt spoil the output

Input Splits:

Block => HDFS

INPUTSPLIT = logical pointer

Mapper => MapReduce	
	
	block => 64mb => 67108864 bytes => 
	vasu => java variable => 4 bytes
	
	block1 => va
	block2 => su
	
=========================================================	
	
combiner:

	local reducer/ semi reducer / mini reducer 
		which works at mapper level
		
		reuses reducer logic on mapper output at mapper machine level

		can I always use reducer as combiner? YES, but conditions apply
		
		commutative and associative principles then you can use.
		
			a + b = b + a; ** order is not important
			a * b = b * a;
			
			a - b <> b -a ; dont use reducer as combiner
			a/b <> b/a ; 
			
			a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c; ** group doesnt matter

			sum of 1 million nubmers => addition 
			avg of 1 million numbers => sum.of.obs/no.of.obs
			
partitioner
	
	traffic police => route the vehicles
		routes the key-value pairs to reducer based on keys
		
		hash partitioner algorithm => default 
	
		ex: divisibility example
