
Hello Good Morning..!
---------------------

New Tool: "HIVE"

What is the work of a partitioner?
	> Traffic Police => which routes the key-value pairs to the right reducers
							based on their keys.
							
							
		hi, hello, how, are, you => 3 reducers => red1, red2, red3
		
		Hash mechanism => Hash Partitioner => hash is special number for a key => direction
								all same keys => always go to same reducer
								
								
							Hi => red1
							
						at any cost, all HI's will always go to RED1
						
		Partitioner => a class in mapreduce 
						custom => self design => our own
						=> create your own partitioner class => extend (subclass) + modify
												=> method overrideing

						example: Hi => red1 ;; 
						Dictonary => word count => if you need 26 files as output , what to do?
												set 26 reducer; 
							Project + Assignment: => google + how to route + logic to route
										using dictionary => download
